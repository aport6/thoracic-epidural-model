Thoracic epidurals are used for analgesia in many chest and abdominal surgeries. Their use has been shown to improve surgical outcomes. Residents often struggle in their first attempts at thoracic epidurals. Learning the anatomy, visualizing the geometry of the needle approach, and developing a feel for the relevant tissues can prove challenging. We developed an inexpensive educational model for thoracic epidurals using 3D-printing and other DIY tools. In the manual, we provide step-by-step instructions on fabrication and assembly of this model.
